    <p> My favorite brand is Zara. It's a Spanish clothing company that managed to expand internationally.
Zara is considered a ready-to-wear clothing company,with more than two thousand stores around the world. What I love about Zara is that they have high quality clothes that almost feel luxurious and, at the same time, are affordable and reasonable prices. Their branding is also minimalist and reflects the same aspects of sophistication and luxury as the designers' brands. Thanks to their quality, customer service, and inspiration from luxury brands  Zara made their legacy in fashion and is now one of the world's largest international fashion companies. </p>
	  
	 <h3> Why Zara? </h3>
    <p>
Besides being my favourite brand when it comes to fashion and style, I consider Zara a favourite brand in regards to their branding, marketing, and brand image.
As I said before, Zara's branding relies on minimalism, and being a person who loves minimalist designs, I was attracted to the branding that they use for their stores, packaging, and all their digital platforms, including their social media and websites. They use an achromatic color palette that is based on two colors: black and white. 
For their logo, they use a typeface called Didot. This typeface is serif and it reminds us of the typefaces that are used on fashion magazines' covers.</p>
	  
	   <h3> How will Zara inspire my design ?
 </h3>
    <p> The Zara branding will be my main inspiration to build the website. Their website is very simple yet interesting to navigate and does not look like any other shopping website.
My web design will be minimalist. I plan to rely on the contrast that I will create between the background, which is going to be mainly in black, and the content ( navigation, headings, body...) that is going to be in white.
Zara's website uses a plain white color for the background and black for its content. I plan on doing the opposite and always keeping a minimalistic aspect. 
Regarding the typefaces, I will be using a Montserrat ( normal ) font and I will stick to the same font family for the headings and only change the type to bold.</p>

	 <h3>PAST EVENT </h3>
		
		
<p> 
As a human being, our lives and personalities change through multiple and different experiences that we go through,some of which we don't even remember,especially when we were little kids and our brains and bodies were not prepared to process a lot of things. But as we grow older, we begin to see things from a different perspective, we begin to interpret things in new ways, and life begins to throw us some surprises.
 
One of the remarkable life experiences that I had to go through when I was seventeen years old was moving from my parents' house and going to live in another city for the purpose of studying.
At the very beginning, I wasn't thinking of it that much. All I was thinking of was what degree I wanted to pursue, but when the day was starting to get closer, I started getting that butterflies feeling in my stomach and I started thinking of my parents all the time,especially my mom, with whom I had a very close relationship. I was always in her shadow. She was my mother,my best friend, and my confidant. This was going to be the first time that I would leave my city, my home, for a long,long time. My head was always traveling, I was asking myself too many questions.
 
The day came, and my luggage was all set and ready next to the front door. As for me,I was trying so hard to hold my tears and to not cry in front of my parents and siblings, but as soon as I got on the train, I bursted into tears and I went ahead for a 7-hour trip on a lifetime journey.
 
From the first day,I had to go through various challenges,I had to find an apartment on my own,and do everything independently of my parents, who used to do everything before.
 
Thanks to that experience, I am who I am today. I am independent and lead my life with my hands. Two years after that day,I had to move to another country,which is normally harder and more challenging than moving from a city to another city in your home country, but for me it was easier than I thought it would have been. Although moving to another country comes with its own pitfalls and obstacles, like not knowing the language, feeling very lonely,different,misunderstood,the first experience that I had helped me enormously to overcome all of these obstacles.
