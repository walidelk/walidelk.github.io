    <p>A brand identity is a major part of the marketing plan of a business, and it refers to
the set of tools or elements used by a company to create a brand image. A brand
image is a customer's perception of the brand, consisting of various associations
related to it and memories about interacting with it. A brand's identity and its
elements stem from a companyâ€™s mission, brand value proposition, long-term goals,
competitive position on the market, and relevance to the values and interests of the
target audience. These factors have a foundational nature and, in the branding
process, describe what a company wants to communicate.</p>

    <p>As mentioned before, branding is not only going to help a brand differentiate from the
competition, but it also gives the audience a compelling reason to choose a
particular brand.</p>
<p>There are different strategies that a brand can use to engage its audience and
resonate with who they are, but generally, the aim of every strategy is to make the
audience remember the business, and the best way to do this is to give them a

	  <h4>What are the most important strategies?</h4>
There are many brand strategies, but I am going to focus on four important ones :
	  
<ul>
	<li> Experiential Branding</li>
		<li> Activist Branding</li>
		<li> Personality Branding</li>
		<li> Personality Branding</li>
	</ul>
	  
	  
<h4>Experiential Branding</h4>
Experiential branding is all about actively designing sensory engagements with the
audience, and these sensory engagements are usually very unique. The advantage
of these sensory engagements is that they are easily remembered, making it easier
for the audience to recall the brand.
<h4>Activist Branding</h4>
This branding strategy is all about brands being more vocal about issues within
society or political issues. There is no room for error in this strategy, which is why the
tiniest mistake can lead to a viral scandal.
<h4>Personality Branding</h4>
This strategy is a lot more simplistic and applicable than the previous ones. There is
nothing really technical about this approach; it relies on a good definition of the
audience and understanding them on an intimate level and the type of
communication that they would respond to and give, then giving them that
communication and eventually providing them with whatever resonates with them.
The beauty of this strategy is that it is not complicated; it's effective, efficient, and
economical as well, and if it's done right, it can really engage the audience with who
they are and what they want, really connect with them on an emotional level, and
capture their hearts as well.
<h4>Distinctive asset branding:</h4>
Being distinctive is key for any brand out there; this will help the audience remember
a brand when they are making their buying decision. The reason why distinctive
brand assets are effective is that they create memory structures, and the more
memory structures that we have for a brand, the better chance we have of finding
our way back to that brand experience or remembering that brand during the buying
decision. Therefore, a brand should consider creating as many distinctive assets as
possible and putting them on the market, on social media platforms, on websites, or
at any other single touchpoint to give their audience the best possible chance of
remembering their brand.
	  
<h4>Social Media Content</h4>
<p>In an age that is governed by social media, every brand has to be very indulgent and
give serious attention to their social media accounts. Social media is the most
important medium between a brand and their audiences these days, which means
any business or organization should hire a highly professional team to manage their
social media accounts in order to get the best results out of them. A brand's social
media team should at least be composed of a community manager, a content
specialist, a social media manager, and a digital marketer; each of them will be
assigned a different task that will take their audiences through a unique digital brand
experience. A good brand experience can help brands build a close relationship with
their audiences that will eventually advocate for them and take marketing actions on
their behalf. </p>
